First two figures are the runs with iffy .. becaus
the sim variable passed is potentially changed in the second range call
(object arguments are always by reference)
The third figure is the result after fixing that issue.
Still  I don't see huge change in behaviour. I was hoping to see big
change in result with utc factor change but nothing of that sort so far.
